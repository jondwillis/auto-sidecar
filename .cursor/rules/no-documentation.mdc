DO NOT create documentation files (.md, .txt, SUMMARY, CHANGELOG, etc.) unless explicitly requested by the user.

This includes:
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- CHANGES.md, CHANGES-SUMMARY.md
- FIXES.md, IMPROVEMENTS.md
- Any kind of summary or overview documents

Focus on code changes only. The git history and commit messages are sufficient documentation.
